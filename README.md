# Ticketguru üõ´

A sample project aiming testing Java Virtual Threads and, at the same time, showing how to do that using a implementation of (almost) real use case. üòâüöÄ

Basically, we want to simulate a travel agency fetching for flight tickets in different providers. To accomplish this mission we trying three different approaches. 



#### üíæ Tech Stack (that you'll need) 

- [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [K6](https://k6.io/)

#### üîß Infra

Before running the application it is necessary provides the infrastructure required. Therefore, execute *Docker Compose* script placed in: `src/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml`

It will spin up 2 fake company providers, responsible for simulate our flight ticket providers.
And they might be accessed in:

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:8081/api/ticket'
curl --location 'localhost:8082/api/ticket'
```



#### üìù Usage

After docker compose script already have running, to start Ticketguru in development mode use:
```shell
mvn quarkus:dev
```
**It must be executed with wrapper in case Maven not been previously installed locally in your machine.* 

```shell
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

This micro *(to not say tiny)* service has three endpoints that might be found in: 

üíª http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/#/  **(application must be running)*



All of them returns the same payload, just differs *how* they perform their roles. Although names are self explained, a simple description follows below:

| Endpoint            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ***/search***       | Sequential approach doing regular calls based on platform threads. |
| ***/search-async*** | Async calls based on Completable Future and Thread Pool over platform threads. |
| ***/search-vt***    | Sequential calls using the brand new *<u>Virtual Threads</u>* |



### Running the performance test

[Since K6 loading test tool has been installed](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/), you'll need to execute it against Ticketguru application.
To do this, we provide a quite straightforward script, located in .... It contains:

```  javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {

  stages: [
    { duration: '20s', target: 200 }, // Ramp up config
    { duration: '60s', target: 1000}, // Total users simulated in the test
    { duration: '20s', target: 0 },
  ]
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://localhost:8080/api/search-vt') // microservice url
  check(res, { 'status was 200': (r) => r.status == 200 })
  sleep(1)
}
```



Feel free to play with script and try different test setup! ü§ñ
